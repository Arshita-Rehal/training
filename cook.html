    <h2><center>COOKING</center></h2>
    <p>
        Cooking, also known as cookery or professionally as the culinary arts, is the art, science and craft of using
        heat to make food more
        palatable, digestible, nutritious, or safe. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food
        over an open fire, to using
        electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions. Cooking is an aspect of all
        human societies and a cultural universal.

        <p>Most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as
            herbs and spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the
            yeast used in baking are kinds of fungi. Cooks also use water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use
            wine or spirits.

            Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins, carbohydrates and
            fats. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of
            these molecules
